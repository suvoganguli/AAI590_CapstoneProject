# AAI590_CapstoneProject

This repository contains code and documentation for my AAI 590 Capstone Project: **Rapid ICU Mortality Prediction**.

## Project Overview

The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict in-hospital mortality for ICU patients using time-series physiological data. The dataset is derived from the PhysioNet 2012 Challenge and available on Kaggle in a cleaned format.

- Dataset: [Predict Mortality of ICU Patients (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msafi04/predict-mortality-of-icu-patients-physionet/data)
- Records: 4,000 ICU stays
- Data: Demographics, vitals, labs, outcomes
